## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification

- **Decision Trees** – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/Decision-tree-ML-modal)  
- **Random Forest** – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/crop-fertilizer-prediction)  
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** – [SVM Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/legal-app)  
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** – [KNN Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/salary-pridiction-app). 
- **Logistic Regression** – [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/plant-pridiction-based-on-image)  
- **Naive Bayes** – [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/naive-bayes-modal)

- **Ridge Regression** – [Ridge Regression Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/house-rent-prediction)
- **Lasso Regression** – [Lasso Regression Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/house-rent-prediction)
- **Elastic Net Regression** – [Elastic Net Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/house-rent-prediction)

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses **unlabeled data** to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering

- **K-Means** – [K-Means Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/airline-cost-and-time-priction-app) 
- **Hierarchical Clustering** – [Hierarchical Clustering Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/clustering-tool)
- **DBSCAN** – [DBSCAN Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/drugs-dosage-provider)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)* – [PCA Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/plant-pridiction-based-on-image)

### 3. Associate rull 
- **Apriori Algorithm** - [Apriori Algorithm Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/shopping-analysis)
