## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification

- **Decision Trees** – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/Decision-tree-ML-modal)  
- **Random Forest** – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/crop-fertilizer-prediction)  
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** – [SVM Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/legal-app)  
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** – [KNN Repo]  
- **Logistic Regression** – [Logistic Regression Repo]  
- **Naive Bayes** – [Naive Bayes Repo]

### 2. Regression

- **Linear Regression** – [Linear Regression Repo] 
- **Ridge Regression** – [Ridge Regression Repo]
- **Lasso Regression** – [Lasso Regression Repo]
- **Elastic Net Regression** – [Elastic Net Repo]

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses **unlabeled data** to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering

- **K-Means** – [K-Means Repo]  
- **Hierarchical Clustering** – [Hierarchical Clustering Repo]
- **DBSCAN** – [DBSCAN Repo]

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)* – [PCA Repo]

### 3. Associate rull 
- **Apriori Algorithm** - [Apriori Algorithm Repo](https://github.com/madhumitha781/shopping-analysis)
